This plugin supports: Banners, Interstitial, Rewarded Videos and Rewarded Interstitials (from version 1.9)

### NEW RELEASE

The code hosted here is not updated anymore. 
The new version of the plugin is available on Nuget and on my website: https://hightouchinnovation.com/XMTAdmob
You can find the new updated sample project for this plugin here: https://github.com/marcojak/XamarinMTAdmobSample

### PLEASE READ
From version 2.1.0, I've added support for the consent required by Google for all the final users living in Europe.
This support for UMP is only available in the licensed version of the plugin.
Without the license, the plugin will continue to work as usual with all the other features normally available.
This will allow me to continue supporting the development of the plugin.
You can buy the license at https://hightouchinnovation.com/XMTAdmob
If you are a charity or your app is used to support a good cause, contact me and I'll evaluate it to send you a free license.

**The licensed version unlocks the mandatory Consent required by Google since the 16th of January. 
If you like, you can use the unlicensed version of the plugin and implement your choice of Certified CMP. 
The license will help me to continue updating and supporting this plugin adding all the newer features that Google implements.**

### CRYPTOGRAPHY
This plugin uses a cryptographic algorithm to handle the license.
