### Please, support my work
If possible, please, support my work with few coffees or even better with a Membership!
You can do it here: [Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/xamarinexpert)
Your help allows me to continue to spend time on this project and continue to maintain and update it with new features and to be ready for the new Google SDK 20: [Google SDK 20 Migration](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/migration).

### IMPORTANT
* On Android you need to add your Admob APPLICATION_ID to your AppManifest.
* On iOS you need to add GADApplicationIdentifier to your Info.plist:
  Edit your info.plist adding these Keys:
  <key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
  <string>ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~1458002511</string> <- This is a test key, replace it with your APPID
  <key>GADIsAdManagerApp</key>
  <true/>
* If you don't do this, your iOS app will crash

* I'm slowly starting to move toward AndroidX, so it's possible that you need to install more packages in your Android project, in case of a build error,
  Visual Studio will tell you which packages you need to install.

HOW TO USE MTADMOB

BANNER

To add a Banner on a page you have two options:

XAML

<controls:MTAdView x:Name="myAds"></controls:MTAdView>

remember to add this line in your XAML:

xmlns:controls="clr-namespace:MarcTron.Plugin.Controls;assembly=Plugin.MtAdmob"

CODE

MTAdView ads = new MTAdView();

Now you can add the control to your layout.

PROPERTIES

For each AdView if you want, you can set these properties:
AdsId: To add the id of your ads

For GDPR it's better to rely on a custom consent instead or using the non personalized ads as I cannot guarantee it works. So it's better if you create a custom consent

GLOBAL PROPERTIES

AdsId: To add the id of your ads

PersonalizedAds: You can set it to False if you want to use generic ads (for GDPR...)(It works only for Android Banners, for the others, you must ask for consent)
For GDPR it's better to rely on a custom consent instead or using the non personalized ads as I cannot guarantee it works. So it's better if you create a custom consent

TestDevices: You can add here the ID of your test devices

You can use Global Properties in this way:
CrossMTAdmob.Current.UserPersonalizedAds = true;


INTERSTITIAL

You can show an interstitial with a single line of code:

CrossMTAdmob.Current.ShowInterstitial();

To Load an interstitial you can use this line:

CrossMTAdmob.Current.LoadInterstitial("xx-xxx-xxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxx");

REWARDED VIDEO

You can show a Rewarded video with a single line of code:

CrossMTAdmob.Current.ShowRewardedVideo();

To Load a Rewarded Video you can use this line:

CrossMTAdmob.Current.LoadRewardedVideo("xx-xxx-xxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxx");


EVENTS FOR BANNERS

Just in case you need, the Banner ads offer 4 events:

AdsClicked		When a user clicks on the ads
AdsClosed		When the user closes the ads
AdsImpression	Called when an impression is recorded for an ad.
AdsOpened		When the ads is opened



EVENTS FOR INTERSTITIALS

the Interstitial ads offer 3 events:

OnInterstitialLoaded        When it's loaded
OnInterstitialOpened        When it's opened      
OnInterstitialClosed        When it's closed



EVENTS FOR REWARDED VIDEOS

The Rewarded Videos offer 7 events:

OnRewarded                          When the user gets a reward
OnRewardedVideoAdClosed             When the ads is closed
OnRewardedVideoAdFailedToLoad       When the ads fails to load
OnRewardedVideoAdLeftApplication    When the users leaves the application
OnRewardedVideoAdLoaded             When the ads is loaded
OnRewardedVideoAdOpened             When the ads is opened
OnRewardedVideoStarted              When the ads starts


IMPORTANT

Remember to include the MTAdmob library with this code (usually it's added automatically):
```
using MarcTron.Plugin;
```

IMPORTANT

To test the banner during the development google uses two Banner Id, one for Android and the other for iOS. Use them then remember to replace them with your own IDs:
Android: ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/6300978111
iOS: ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/2934735716


If the Banners don't appear in your app, probably it's a size problem. To solve it, add this style you your app.xaml:

<Style TargetType="controls:MTAdView">
    <Setter Property="HeightRequest">
        <Setter.Value>
            <x:OnIdiom Phone="50" Tablet="90"></x:OnIdiom>
        </Setter.Value>
    </Setter>
</Style>

IMPORTANT FOR ANDROID:

Before loading ads, you need to call MobileAds.initialize() on OnCreate: 


protected override void OnCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
        {
            TabLayoutResource = Resource.Layout.Tabbar;
            ToolbarResource = Resource.Layout.Toolbar;

            base.OnCreate(savedInstanceState);

            MobileAds.Initialize(this);   <---
            Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init(this, savedInstanceState); 
            LoadApplication(new App());
        }

Remeber to add this to your AppManifest:

<!-- Sample AdMob App ID: ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713 -->
<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
           android:value="ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx~yyyyyyyyyy"/>


IMPORTANT FOR IOS:

In case the plugin doesn't install automatically the nuget package 
Xamarin.Google.iOS.MobileAds
you need to add it manually.

That's it. Cannot be easier than that :)
